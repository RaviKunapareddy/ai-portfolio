# Chatbot Backend Integration

## Overview

This document explains the updates made to integrate the enhanced chatbot backend API with your portfolio frontend. The changes focus on maintaining backward compatibility while enabling access to the new API capabilities.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced API Client

The `ChatbotClient` in `src/lib/api-clients/chatbot.ts` has been updated to:

- Support the new API response formats
- Handle both old and new backend structures
- Add support for advanced filtering capabilities
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing code

### 2. Key Improvements

#### Product Types

Added support for new product fields from the enhanced API:

```typescript
export interface Product {
  // Existing fields
  id?: string;
  name?: string;
  price?: number;
  // ...

  // Enhanced fields from new API
  brand?: string;
  image?: string;
  originalPrice?: number;
  inStock?: boolean;
  reviewCount?: number;
  
  // Vector search specific fields
  similarity_score?: number;
  rerank_score?: number;
}
```

#### Enhanced Health Check

Added support for the comprehensive health check response:

```typescript
export interface HealthCheckResponse {
  // Existing fields
  status: string;
  project: string;
  project_id: string;
  environment: string;
  
  // New fields from enhanced API
  services?: {
    redis?: string;
    pinecone_products?: string;
    pinecone_support?: string;
    pinecone?: string;
  };
  usage_monitoring?: {
    daily_requests: number;
    monthly_embeddings: number;
    free_tier_limits: {
      daily_requests_limit: number;
      monthly_embeddings_limit: number;
      note: string;
    };
  };
}
```

#### Enhanced Search Parameters

Added support for advanced filtering in product search:

```typescript
export interface ProductSearchParams {
  q?: string;
  limit?: number;
  brand?: string;
  category?: string;
  rating_min?: number;
  in_stock?: boolean;
  discount_min?: number;
  tags?: string;
}
```

#### Response Format Handling

Added logic to handle both old and new API response formats:

```typescript
// Check if the response has a products property (new API format)
if (response.data && response.data.products) {
  return {
    ...response,
    data: response.data.products
  };
}

// Return as-is for old format
return response;
```

### 3. UI Integration

The ChatbotDemo component has been updated to initialize the client with the provided API endpoint:

```typescript
// Initialize client with the provided API endpoint
const client = useMemo(() => new ChatbotClient(apiEndpoint), [apiEndpoint]);
```

## Testing

A test script (`src/test-api-client.ts`) has been created to verify the client works correctly with the enhanced backend. It tests:

1. Health check endpoint with enhanced response
2. Basic product search (backward compatibility)
3. Enhanced product search with filters
4. Chat endpoint

## Future Enhancements

While the current implementation focuses on API compatibility without UI changes, future enhancements could include:

1. Adding filter UI components to leverage the advanced search capabilities
2. Creating an admin dashboard to display usage statistics
3. Implementing personalized product recommendations based on user preferences

## Conclusion

The updated API client now works seamlessly with both the old and new backend, maintaining backward compatibility while enabling access to the enhanced features when needed. The UI remains unchanged, providing a clean and focused user experience.
